    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This baked chicken pasta recipe is made with penne pasta and rotisserie chicken; it is a quick version of a chicken alfredo bake. Serve with garlic bread and a green salad for a no-fuss weeknight meal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups penne pasta</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup 1% milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 cup cubed rotisserie chicken</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat and cook garlic for 1 minute. Whisk in flour until a paste forms. Pour in milk and cream, whisking continuously until smooth. Stir in 3/4 of the Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and nutmeg. Add drained penne pasta and cooked chicken; stir to combine. Pour mixture into a casserole dish. Sprinkle with remaining cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
